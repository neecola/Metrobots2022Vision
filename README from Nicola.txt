Hey guys, last night I finished some stuff that I started during practice yesterday.
I organized the code so that now we only have 1 file for the ball recognition.

Now the repository is made of the main file, the ball processing file, the tape recognition file and
a settings file (the file where we store what team we are and the settings for the thresholding for both blue and red balls)
